# Future Improvements & Production Readiness

This document outlines what could be done to further improve retrieval quality and make the system production-ready.

---

## Retrieval Quality Improvements

### 1. Re-ranking with Cross-Encoders
Add a second-stage re-ranker after initial retrieval to improve precision. Cross-encoders are more accurate than embeddings for scoring query-document relevance but too slow for initial retrieval.

**Expected impact:** +10-20% MRR, +15-25% Precision@5

### 2. Hybrid Search (Sparse + Dense Embeddings)
Combine vector similarity search with traditional keyword matching (BM25). Vector embeddings capture semantic meaning while BM25 catches exact term matches, especially useful for technical queries.

**Expected impact:** +5-10% Recall@5

### 3. Query Expansion
Automatically expand user queries with domain-specific synonyms (e.g., "candidate" → "applicant"). This helps retrieve relevant documents that use different terminology.

**Expected impact:** +5-10% Recall@5

### 4. Metadata Filtering
Extract hints from queries (service names, HTTP methods) and use them to pre-filter the search space. Reduces noise and improves precision when applicable.

**Expected impact:** +20-30% Precision when filters apply

### 5. Better Embeddings Model
Upgrade from `text-embedding-3-small` to `text-embedding-3-large`. Larger models capture more nuanced semantic relationships at the cost of higher API fees.

**Expected impact:** +3-8% across all metrics

## Production Readiness

### Robustness & Reliability

**Circuit Breakers:** Fail fast when external services are down instead of accumulating timeouts. Prevents cascading failures.

**Retry Mechanisms:** Retry logic with exponential backoff for all OpenAI API calls using the `tenacity` library. This prevents transient network failures from breaking the system.

**Fallback LLM Providers:** Automatically switch to backup providers (OpenAI → Anthropic → local model) when primary fails. Increases uptime.

**Rate Limiting:** Protect API from abuse and control costs by limiting requests per user/IP.

**Caching:** Cache embeddings and LLM responses to reduce costs (50-80% savings) and improve latency (10-100x faster for cache hits).

**Timeouts:** Set explicit timeouts on all external calls (LLM, embeddings, vector store) to prevent hanging requests.

### Monitoring & Observability

**Structured Logging:** Use structured logs with context (user_id, query, latency) for easier debugging and analysis in log aggregation tools.

**Metrics Collection:** Track P50/P95/P99 latencies, error rates, cache hit rates, and throughput using Prometheus + Grafana.

**Distributed Tracing:** Use OpenTelemetry to trace requests across services and identify bottlenecks (embedding vs retrieval vs LLM generation).

**Alerting:** Set up alerts for high error rates (>5%), high latency (P95 >5s), or vector store downtime.

### Scalability

**Async Operations:** Use asyncio to run independent operations (query rewriting, retrieval) in parallel. Reduces response time by 30-50%.

**Batch Processing:** Process multiple documents/queries at once to reduce API overhead and improve throughput.

**Vector Store Scaling:** Migrate from ChromaDB to production-grade vector stores (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant) for better performance and auto-scaling at higher load.

**Load Balancing:** Deploy multiple API instances behind a load balancer to handle more concurrent users.

### Data Quality

**Chunk Validation:** Filter out chunks that are too short (<50 chars), too long (>2000 chars), or empty to improve retrieval quality.

**Duplicate Detection:** Use content hashing to avoid storing duplicate chunks that waste storage and dilute retrieval results.

**Freshness Checks:** Periodically check if OpenAPI specs have changed (using ETags or timestamps) and refresh the vector store automatically.

**Schema Validation:** Validate OpenAPI specs before processing to catch malformed documents early.
